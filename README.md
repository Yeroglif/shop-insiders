# A react app that has a list of products to play around in
### Installing the project:
clone it, npm install and you are good to go. Don't forget to install tailwind css and material ui (I used mui for the rating component, the tailwind is mostly for flexboxes)
The site uses fanta.css https://www.fantacss.smoljames.com/ made by SmolJames. It is very nice looking and is good for most simple websites.

You can checkout the site demo at Netlify once I get around to build it there
